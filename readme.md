# Mirror-Divide

Mirror Divide is a platformer puzzle game created by Team KONAM.

The game introduction:

The Company, a secret organization that investigates global mysteries and unknown phenomena, has discovered a new realm: the Mirror Dimension.

They sent researchers into this dimension, but when it became unstable, the Company decided to abandon them.

Upon hearing this, a legendary retired agent set out to rescue his junior researcher.

However, due to the dimension's instability, the agentâ€™s body was split into multiple entities upon entry.

Your goal is to become the agent, merge the split bodies, and venture deeper into the dimension to find and save the researcher.

Solve puzzles, defeat enemies spawned by the unstable realm, and complete your mission.
