## 🎮 Game Introduction

The Company, a secret organization that investigates global mysteries and unknown phenomena, has discovered a new realm: the **Mirror Dimension**.

They dispatched researchers into this strange dimension. However, when the realm became unstable, the Company chose to abandon their team.

Upon hearing this, a legendary retired agent set out to rescue his junior researcher. But as he entered the unstable dimension, his body split into multiple entities.

Now, it's up to you — as the agent — to **merge the split bodies**, **solve puzzles**, **defeat enemies**, and **venture deeper** into the Mirror Dimension to save the researcher.
